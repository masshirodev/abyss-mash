# Mash's Abyss Addons

Pookie stole some of my money by deleting entries from the payment log, so y'all can have this. I'm done.

All these addons need to be updated to work with the new abyss update, gotta add the google stopwatch library to the dependencies too. I don't provide support for anything related to abyss, I cba.

Hopefully some ppl on abyss grow up to be more mature. Good luck, you're going to need it.
